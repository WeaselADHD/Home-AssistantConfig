    <summary><b>The Automation Process:</b> - Click here to expand</summary>

      - **Appliance Trigger:**
          - Enter the power sensor entity that measures the live current draw of the appliance. Common devices with these sensors include smart plugs, energy meters, etc.
          - The automation is triggered when the appliance's current draw exceeds a set wattage.
          - The automation ends when the appliance's current draw falls below a set value.

      - **Notification Options:**
          - Send notification messages to one or multiple devices when the appliance starts and/or finishes.
          - Your end message can include estimates of total power consumption and cost.
          - Notifications are compatible with both Apple iOS and Android devices, ensuring universal accessibility.

      - **Power Tracking:**
          - Utilize power tracking for estimating total power consumption and cost. 
          
          ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer** - These values are estimates and should only be used as a guide. Please avoid relying solely on these estimates for accuracy and use them at your own risk. We cannot be held responsible for any inaccuracies or resulting losses, damages, inconvenience, or anything else that may occur.

      - **Custom Actions:**
          - Tailor custom actions to suit your preferences and needs, enhancing the automation's functionality.
          - Configure actions such as triggering announcements on platforms like The Voice (HA), Google, Alexa, etc., to keep you informed about appliance events.

      - **Time-Based Automation:**
          - Specify precise start and end times along with weekday selections to define when the automation can run.

      - **Custom Conditions:**
          - Enter any custom conditions to further customize the automation process.

        **Note** If you choose a daily total sensor that spans across two days, the information may not be accurate.
        This is because the values should increase continuously from the start to the end of the cycle, without resetting back to 0.0 kWh the next day.
